### 'Planets' by teamLab

Teamlab is a group of Japanese artists and scientists working in designing digitally interactive experiences in and surrounding Tokyo. Together, this group has consistently striven to make the digitally generated rooms fully immersive for the viewer - taking artwork away from physical, static mediums, and probing the viewer to become part of the artwork itself. In the case of their work showcased at the Planets exhibit, the team presents to the museum-goers a series of works that are three dimensional, in which there appear no boundaries nor a guiding map of the space. The art featured is constantly in motion, creating a multi-sensory experience. The viewer has the opportunity to walk through multiple spaces. For example, the work 'Floating in the Falling Universe of Flowers,' the audience encounters a burst of purple flowers exploding on one side, and a bunch of sunflowers blooming on the other. The artwork moves seemlessly and freely, denoting a live performance of the natural world. This artwork presents a new opportunity for the audience; a place in which they are unaware of their physical limitations, and they have the freedom traverse the room as far as their eye leads them into nature. Another work that I was immediately drawn to in the 'Planets' museum space is 'Drawing on the Water Surface Created by the Dance of Koi and People - Infinity.' In this piece, people can walk into the water and into the Koi fish. The Koi move by the presence of people also moving through the digitized water. If the Koi collides with people in the space, they transform into flowers and scatter. 

### 'Remote Sensing' by Suzanne Anker

Suzanne Anker's 'Remote Sensing' is an artwork that interweaves digital sculpture and biological sciences. In her work, she uses a variety of mediums to transform photographic works into digitzed botanical specimens. She marks herself in the artistic sphere of Bio Art, utilizing technology in order to explore themes of environmental degradation and species extinction.This work is developed from her artwork 'Vanitas in a Petri Dish'. Vanitas showcased various natural and unnatural objects in decay by using the Petri dish as a three dimensional canvas. Using these Petri dishes, she formed a 3D-printed landscape from the color and texture data obtained in her Vanitas piece. Another work of hers that immediately captured my attention was her installation 'Astroculture (Eternal Return)'. Employing the same LED light technology used by NASA to grow plants in space, Anker's work created vegetable producing plants from seeds.
